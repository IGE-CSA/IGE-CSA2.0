<b>Goal:</b> Reach the last number in the Fibonacci series on the game board (Last number number = (num rows * num columns) - 1 --> index number in array of Fibonnaci numbers). For our 3 by 3 grid, you must reach the Fibonacci number 34 to win. 

<br>
<br>

<b>How to Play:</b>
<br>
<br>
1. Start the Game:
- The game board is initially filled with two randomly placed 1s.
- The Fibonacci series begins with 1, 1.
<br>
<br>
2. Make a Move:
- Enter a direction to move the numbers (up, down, left, or right).
- The numbers will move in the chosen direction, and the game board will be updated.
<br>
<br>
3. Combine Numbers:
- When two adjacent non-zero numbers are moved into each other's path, they will combine into a new number.
- The new number must be part of the Fibonacci series.
<br>
<br>
4. Winning/Losing 
- Winning: The game is won when the last number in the Fibonacci series appears on the board. 
- Losing: The game is lost when there are no available spaces to fill with new 1s.
<br>
<br>
5. Scoreboard
- After you have won/lost, your total score (sum of all the fibonnaci numbers on your final board) will be saved and displayed on our player scoreboard.
